Train/Test Split

The dataset was divided into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

80% of the data was used for training

20% of the data was used for testing

This split ensures that the model generalizes well and does not overfit.


Evaluation Metrics

To measure model performance, the following metrics were used:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion Matrix

These metrics help evaluate both overall performance and how well the model detects churn customers.


Best Result

Three models were trained and compared:

Logistic Regression: 82% accuracy

Random Forest: 79% accuracy

XGBoost: 81% accuracy

Best Model: Logistic Regression
It achieved the highest accuracy (82%) and provided the best overall performance on the test dataset.
